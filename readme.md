Spacebrew Arduino Examples  
==========================  
  
This is a collection of sketches that use the Spacebrew library for Arduino. A network connection is required for these sketches to connect to Spacebrew. Therefore, these sketches and the Spacebrew library can only run on Ethernet Arduinos and Arduinos with an Ethernet shield.   
  
Get the collection by clicking the DOWNLOADS button in the top right corner. Then copy the sketches into your Arduino sketches folder. You also need to make sure that you have the following two Arduino libraries:  
* Spacebrew library for Arduino: download from github at https://github.com/labatrockwell/spacebrew-arduino-library  
* WebSocketClient library for Arduino: donwload from github at https://github.com/labatrockwell/ArduinoWebsocketClient  
   
Button  
------  
Sketch that connects an Arduino, with button and an led, to Spacebrew. A publication channel sends out boolean values that represent the switch's state, while the boolean values received via the subscription channel is used to turn on and off the led.  
  
Input_Output  
------------  
Sketch that connects an Arduino, with a button, an analog input (such as a pot or photoresistor), and two leds, to Spacebrew. This sketch features three publication and three subscription channels.  
* The publication channels include a boolean channel for the button state, a range channel for the analog input state, and a string that parrots back string messages received from Spacebrew.  
* The subscription channels include a boolean channel to blink one of the leds, a range channel to set the brightness of the second led, and a string channel that parrots back messages to Spacebrew.  
  
Spacebrew Forwarder  
-------------------  
The spacebrew library requires a decent amount of SRAM and sometimes conflicts with the libraries required to connect the arduino to select components, such as the Adafruit PN532 NFC/RFID Shield (http://adafruit.com/products/789) and the Sparkfun MPR121 Capacitive Touch Sensor Breakout Board (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9695).  
  
That's why we've created a two arduino set-up, where one arduino captures data from sensors and components, and then sends the data via serial to another ethernet-enabled arduino, which forwards it to Spacebrew.  Check-out the readme file in the spacebrew_forwader directory for more details about these example.
